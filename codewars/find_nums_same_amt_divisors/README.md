## Find Numbers with Same Amount of Divisors  

### Parameters:
* diff: difference between two numbers to be compared
* nMax: the upper bound of numbers to consider  

### Task:
* create a function count_pairsInt that returns the number of pairs of positive  
integers below nMax that have the same number of divisors

### Examples:
    count_pairsInt(1, 50) -----> 8 (See case above)
    count_pairsInt(3, 100) -----> 7 (See case above)

## Find most frequent element in a list

Given a singly linked list, write code to find the most frequent element value  
and how many times it ocurrs. In case of duplicate number of ocurrences, return  
the element value closest to the head.

The output should be returned as a pair, where the first item is the value, and  
the second the number of times it appears.

### Example:
    1->2->3->4->2->3->2 => (2,3): Element 2 ocurrs 3 times
    
    4->3->5->3->4->5 => (4,2): Element 4 ocurrs 2 times

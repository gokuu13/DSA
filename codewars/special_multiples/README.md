## Special Multiples  

Implement a function that finds the amount of numbers smaller than some number  
mxval, that have the the first n primes as factors.

### Examples:
    count_specMult(3, 200)  =>  6 
    
    The first 3 primes are: 2, 3 and 5.
    
    And the found numbers below 200 are: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180.

## Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
    Length(null) => 0
    Length(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null) => 3
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.
    Count(null, 1) => 0
    Count(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> nullptr, 1) => 1
    Count(1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> nullptr, 2) => 4

## Train your skills in creation of classes

In this kata you train your skills in creation of Classes.

### Handled topics are:
- constructor,
- data members,
- class functions,
- copy constructor,
- operator overloading.

The task is simple.
With a help of sample tests you are creating a X() class.  X class contains two  
data members m_a and m_b (default values are [1,2].)
After all missing components of the class are written, it is expected  that  
following lines of code will be compiled (see Initial Solution).

Have fun on training!

Note:
You'll have to implement all the mentioned in "Expected" user cases of the class  
(see Initial Solution) of the class. Until there, you will see compiler errors.

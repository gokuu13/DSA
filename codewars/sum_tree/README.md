## Sum the Tree
Given a node object representing a binary tree:

    struct node{
        int value;
        node *left;
        node *right;
    }

write a function that returns the sum of all values, including the root.  
Absence of a node will be indicated with a null value.

### Examples:
    10
    | \
    1  2
    => 13
    
    1
    | \
    0  0
        \
        2
    => 3

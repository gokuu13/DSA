## Simple Fun #234: Euler's Totient function  

### Task
Given an integer n, find the value of phi(n), where phi is Euler's totient  
function. 

Euler's totient or phi function is an arithmetic function that counts the  
positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.  


### Example:
    phi(5) = 4
    phi(1) = 1

### Notes:
* input is an integer
* $n \in [1, 1000]$
* output is an integer

## 1/n - Cycle

Let n be an integer that is co-prime with 10.  

Find the length of the cycle that occurs after the period when 1 is divided by n.

### Task:
Return the length of the cycle or -1 if n and 10 are not co-prime

### Examples:

    cycle(5) = -1
    cycle(13) = 6 -> 0.076923 076923 0769
    cycle(21) = 6 -> 0.047619 047619 0476
    cycle(27) = 3 -> 0.037 037 037 037 0370
    cycle(33) = 2 -> 0.03 03 03 03 03 03 03 03
    cycle(37) = 3 -> 0.027 027 027 027 027 0
    cycle(94) = -1

## Cartesian neighbors distance

### Task
Create a function cartesianNeighborsDistance that takes three parameters x, y  
and range and returns unique distance of points within the neighborhood range  
from (x, y).

### Notes:
* Distances in list don't have to be sorted
* Round the distances upt to 10 decimal places

### Example:
    cartesianNeighborsDistance(3, 2, 1) -> {1.4142135624, 1.0}
    cartesianNeighborsDistance(0, 0, 2) -> {1.0, 1.4142135624, 2.0,  
                                            2.2360679775, 2.8284271247}

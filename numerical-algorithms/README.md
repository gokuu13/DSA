# Numerical Algorithms
- Randomizing values
- Breaking numbers into prime factors
- Finding GCD
- Computing geometric areas


## Randomizing Data
Allows for:
    - simulation of random processes
    - test algorithms to see how they behave with random inputs
    - search for solutions to difficult problems

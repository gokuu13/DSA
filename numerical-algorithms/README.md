# Numerical Algorithms
- Randomizing values
- Breaking numbers into prime factors
- Finding GCD
- Computing geometric areas


## Randomizing Data
Allows for:
    - simulation of random processes
    - test algorithms to see how they behave with random inputs
    - search for solutions to difficult problems

### Generating Random Values
- All computer generated random numbers are pseudo-random and can be predicted as long 
as details of the algorithm and it's internal state are known.
- For truly unpredictable randomness:
    - Radiation detector that detects particles coming out of a radioactive sample
    - Dice rolls
    - Analyzing static in radio waves
    - Studying brownian motion
    - Measuring atmospheric noise

# Optimization problem
* to find the optimal solution among a set of feasible solutions, usually  
subject to a set of constraints.

## Types of optimization problems:
1. **Minimization problem**: Find the solution that minimizes the objective value  
given certain constraints. Eg.: minimize the cost of production given certain  
production requirements.
2. **Maximization problem**: Find the solution that maximizes the objective values  
given certain constraints. Eg.: maximize the profits of a business under certain  
market and resource constraints.

### Examples:
* resource allocation
* portfolio optimization
* production planning
* logistics
* scheduling
* machine learning model training

## Categories of solutions:
* Greedy 
* Dynamic programming
* Branch and bound

# Spanning Tree

A spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a graph that connects all the  
vertices without any loops.

## Features
1. **Spanning (Connected):** Includes all the vertices of the graph - every  
vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
2. No cycles
3. $|V| - 1$ edges, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices
4. Each graph has ${|E| \choose |V| - 1}- \#cycles$ possible spanning trees

## Minimum Spanning Tree
Minimum cost tree(by edge) that connects all the vertices. The cost of minimum  
spanning tree is unique for a graph

## Applications
1. Network design
2. Electric circuit analysis
3. Graph algorithms

# Time Complexity
1. Every simple statement in an algorithm is considered to take 1 unit of time  
    regardless of complexity of statement.
2. If the statement is repeated, it is considered to take, the number of  
    repetitions times the time taken by the statement, time.
 
 ## Classes
 1. constant time functions : $O(1)$
 2. logarithmic time functions: $O(log n)$
 3. linear time functions: $O(n)$
 4. quadratic time functions: $O(n^2)$
 5. cubic time functions: $O(n^3)$
 6. exponential time functions: $O(k^n)$

### Comparing classes of functions
$$1 < log(n) < \sqrt{n} < n < n log(n) < n^2 < n^3 < ... < 2^n < 3^n ... < k^n$$

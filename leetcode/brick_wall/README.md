# Brick Wall

There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with n rows of bricks. The  
$i^{th}$ row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one  
unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the  
same.

Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least  
bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is  
not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two  
vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no  
bricks.

Given the 2D array wall that contains the information about the wall, return  
the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: 
        wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],
                [2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
    Output: 2

## Example 2:

    Input: 
        wall = [[1],[1],[1]]
    Output: 3

 

## Constraints:

* $n == wall.length$
* $1 \le n \le 10^4$
* $1 \le wall[i].length \le 10^4$
* $1 \le sum(wall[i].length) \le 2 * 10^4$
* $1 \le wall[i][j] \le 2^{31} - 1$
* sum(wall[i]) is the same for each row i.

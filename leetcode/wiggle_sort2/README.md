# Wiggle Sort II

Given an integer array nums, reorder it such that  
$nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....$

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,5,1,1,6,4]
    Output: [1,6,1,5,1,4]
    Explanation: 
        [1,4,1,5,1,6] is also accepted.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,3,1]
    Output: [2,3,1,3,1,2]

 

## Constraints:

* $1 \le nums.length \le 5 * 10^4$
* $0 \le nums[i] \le 5000$
* It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums.

# Determine if Two Events Have Conflict

You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that  
happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:

* event1 = [startTime_1, endTime_1]
* event2 = [startTime_2, endTime_2]

Event times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.

A conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection  
(i.e., some moment is common to both events).

Return true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return  
false.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: 
        event1 = ["01:15","02:00"]
        event2 = ["02:00","03:00"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
        The two events intersect at time 2:00.

## Example 2:

    Input: 
        event1 = ["01:00","02:00"]
        event2 = ["01:20","03:00"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
        The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.

## Example 3:

    Input: 
        event1 = ["10:00","11:00"]
        event2 = ["14:00","15:00"]
    Output: false
    Explanation: 
        The two events do not intersect.

 

## Constraints:

* $evnet1.length == event2.length == 2.$
* $event1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5$
* $startTime_1 \le endTime_1$
* $startTime_2 \le endTime_2$
* All the event times follow the HH:MM format.

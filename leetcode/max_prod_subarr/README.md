# Maximum Product SubArray

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product,  
and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: 
        The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

 

## Constraints:

* $1 \le nums.length \le 2 * 10^4$
* $-10 \le nums[i] \le 10$
* The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit  
in a 32-bit integer.

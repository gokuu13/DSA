# Arrays

## What?
- Collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Storing multiple items of the same type together makes access easier:
    - The location of the first element is usually denoted by the array name
    - The location of other elements in memory can be calculated by add the 
    offset to the base.
    - Location of next index in memory depends on datatype.
